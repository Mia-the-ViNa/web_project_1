# Learning How to Learn

## Project description:

Learning how to learn is a single page website that include all the informations about the problem with education, learning techniques, TED talks, Barbara Oakley's story, the Feynman technique, facts and figures, Salman Khan's book, ten principles of rapid skill acquisition, and some useful resources.
First, this single page was built by using flexbox layout, positioning, and advanced Html semantics. Then finished the website by adding animations,fonts, and iframes.

The technologies that help creating the website:

- We used Github to save different versions of our files.
- The inspect option on the browser helped with visualize our code position, display.
- W3C is the markup validation service which is very important. It checks the markup (html, xhtml, ...) of web documents.
- We organized the files by following the BEM structure.

## Plans for finalizing:

My website still need some improvements. The website needs more fonts to attract readers. In the future I may add more videos and reading audio for those who don't like to read.
